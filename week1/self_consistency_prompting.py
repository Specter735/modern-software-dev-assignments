You MUST use the following structured thinking process before calculating anything:
1. Extract ALL the explicit numbers and their units from the prompt.
2. Define the total quantity or distance.
3. Identify the position of the first event/stop relative to the start.
4. Identify the position of the second event/stop relative to the end.
5. Formulate an algebraic equation to find the missing middle segment.
6. Solve the equation step-by-step.
7. Always conclude your final response on a new line in this exact format: Answer: <number>
